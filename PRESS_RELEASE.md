There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > WAYN - Where Are You Now

## Sub-Heading ##
  > WAYN is to for people to plan an event and share their distance from the event location.

## Summary ##
  > WAYN will allow people to send out event invites, with a time and location in which attendees can accept and share their location on route.

## Problem ##
  > How many times have you made an event to have everyone arrive fashionably late. Are you tired of being the first one to the party? How many times have you asked all your friends "Hey, how far are you?", "What is your ETA?", "Are you really on your way or are you still at home?"

## Solution ##
  > WAYN will provide a visual map that will show each attendees current location and ETA once they share their geolocation. 

## Quote from You ##
  > "Be fashionably on time" - Someone

## How to Get Started ##
  > A person just needs to pick a time and location and send out an event invite to all of the attendees. Once the attendees recieve the invite and start sharing their location, they will be able to see the current location of all the other attendees.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "All my friends have been showing up on time to my events!" - Someone

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Visit ______ plan your meetup now!
